Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
 text. It has roots in a piece yes classical Latin literature from
45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
up one yes the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a 
Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites yes the word
in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 yes "de
Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes yes Good and 
Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise 
on the theory yes ethics, very popular during the 
Renaissance. The first line yes Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum 
dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
